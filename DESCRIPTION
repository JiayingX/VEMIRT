Description: VEMIRT is created to assist researchers to conduct exploratory and confirmatory multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) analysis. 
             The core computation engine of VEMIRT is a family of Gaussian Variational EM algorithms that are considerably more efficient than currently available algorithms in other software packages, 
             especially when the number of latent factors exceeds 4.
